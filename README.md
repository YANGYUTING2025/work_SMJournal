## 1. Project Mission

To design and develop a "Smart Journaling" application that empowers users to improve emotional awareness and foster personal reflection. By leveraging API-driven data enrichment (weather and sentiment analysis), the project aims to provide a smart, accessible platform that helps users understand emotional patterns and promotes mental well-being, aligning with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being).

## 2. Primary Objectives (Core Functionality - Phase 1)

These objectives represent the minimum viable product (MVP) required to deliver the core functionalities as outlined in the project specification.

### User Authentication:

- Implement a secure user registration and login system based on email and password.

- Persist user account data (Email, Display Name, Password) in a local text file (UserData.txt).

### Core Journaling Interface (CLI):

- Develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI) as the primary user interface.

- Implement functionality for users to Create, View, and Edit daily journal entries.

- Ensure the "Create" and "Edit" options are logically constrained to the current date ("Today").

- Allow users to view any past journal entry.

### Data Persistence:

- Implement file I/O operations to save, load, and update journal entries from user-specific files (e.g., s100201@student.fop_journal.txt).

- Ensure all data (entries, mood, weather) is saved correctly so it persists after the application is closed.

### Dynamic UX Elements:

- Create a time-sensitive welcome message (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening) based on the user's current time (GMT+8).

### API Integration (Automated Enrichment):

- Weather API (GET): Successfully integrate the Malaysian weather data API. Automatically fetch and store the summary_forecast for the current date with the journal entry.

- Sentiment API (POST): Successfully integrate the Hugging Face (DistilBERT SST-2) model API.

- Implement real-time sentiment analysis on the user's journal text.

- Develop value-extraction logic to parse the API JSON response and store the label with the highest score (e.g., "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE") as the user's "mood".

### Data Review:

- Develop a "Weekly Summary" page that displays an overview of the user's mood and recorded weather for the past seven days.

## 3. Secondary Objectives (Enhancements - Phase 2)

These objectives represent future enhancements to improve the project's usability, security, and scalability, as suggested in the "Extra Features" section.

### GUI Implementation:

- Migrate the application from a CLI to a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or a web-based framework (e.g., Spring Boot) to improve user experience.

### Database Migration:

- Upgrade the data storage solution from flat text files to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Firestore).

- Refactor data access logic to use SQL queries or database-specific SDKs.

### Enhanced Security:

- Implement a robust password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, SHA-256) to replace the plaintext password storage, protecting user credentials.
